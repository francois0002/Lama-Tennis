## ➤ Introduction:

Lama Tennis is an app designed to connect tennis players and help them challenge one another within their local clubs.

Having spent my childhood playing tennis, I have always been passionate about this incredible sport. However, as I grew older, I found it increasingly difficult to find regular partners and maintain my enthusiasm for the game. This challenge inspired me to create a platform that fosters competition and camaraderie among players, encouraging them to improve their skills and stay motivated.

With Lama Tennis, players can not only connect with others in their club but also track their progress, earn virtual rewards, and continuously push their boundaries in this wonderful sport. My goal is to reignite the joy of playing tennis for everyone, whether they are beginners or experienced players, and to help build a strong community of tennis enthusiasts.

I wanted the website to be responsive for both web and mobile, adopting a mobile-first development approach.
